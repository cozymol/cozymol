- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @cozymol
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Homelab and Linux, Server, Docker.. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning all of that stuff :P

âš¡âš¡âš¡ 
The heart of my current homelab setup revolves around my TrueNAS Scale server. It hosts a variety of Docker containers, providing entertainment for both myself and my family through our Plex media library.

Moreover, I manage a Proxmox server, serving as a reliable 24/7 gateway to my homelab, allowing me to maintain control from anywhere with ease. The primary OS is Ubuntu Server complemented by the user-friendly CasaOS interface.

In addition, a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 is employed for minor backups and handling simple tasks.

I'm embarking on a new journey with GitHub. Uncertain of what lies ahead, I'm excited to discover the personalized advantages it has in store for me
